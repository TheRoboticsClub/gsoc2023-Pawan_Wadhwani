In the weekly meet on 19th May, Pedro suggested to focus on drone exercise migration, I tested drone exercises, their working and packages.

## Work Done

* Tested solution that uses QR codes in Package Delivery exercise for delivery location
* Tested mini RADI builds and reported the issues with the structuring

I also Beta Tested the Humble RADI and reported the issues faced and suggestions to mentors.

Along with this GSoC organisers held a half day GSoC contributors summit on May 17th, in which previous GSoC students and mentors, who are now working as Full time professionals gave talks on how to have a successful GSoC project, common mistakes made and ways to avoid them. This was very inspiring for the attendees.

## Plan for next week
