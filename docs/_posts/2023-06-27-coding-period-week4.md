This week I majorly focused on how the RAM works, its module structure and the launcher engines. I have got a good grasp while I was
trying to unify the ROS1 and ROS2 launchers.

Pedro also gave a live demo on Aerostack2. I plan to do hands on work on Aerostack2 in the next sprint and see how our existing drone exercises can benefit from it.
