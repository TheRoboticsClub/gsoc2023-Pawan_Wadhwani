Hi everyone! I am extremely excited to work on this project with the JdeRobot Community. I have been contributing to RoboticsAcademy by fixing bugs, creating issues and updating documentation. I believe this project would be crucial to RoboticsAcademy as ROS2 is becoming the new Industry Standard.

## Work Done

* Created Blog website, solved issues with css.
* Revisited ROS2 Tutorials
* Got well acquinted with running, building and debugging Docker Images

I also Beta Tested the Humble RADI and reported the issues faced and suggestions to mentors.

Along with this GSoC organisers held a half day GSoC contributors summit on May 17th, in which previous GSoC students and mentors, who are now working as Full time professionals gave talks on how to have a successful GSoC project, common mistakes made and ways to avoid them. This was very inspiring for the attendees.

## Plan for next week

* Take a look at PX4 Autopilot for ROS2.
* Possibility of drone exercises migration.
